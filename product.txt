April 14, 2015 
 
Executive Summary 
All  of  the  major  hedge  fund  strategy  segments  generated 
positive returns in March, with aggregate average performance 
of +0.53%. For the quarter, hedge funds have returned +2.42% 
in aggregate, well in excess of broader market indices. Global 
macro  outperformed  relative  to  the  other  key  hedge  fund 
strategies.  
Leverage 
Across the Prime Brokerage portfolio, gross leverage1 was flat 
in March at 1.82 (+0.05%). Gross leverage of levered accounts 
also remained stable at 2.36 (+0.04%). Although net exposure2
 
rose  from  0.65  to  0.67  (+1.95%),  hedge  fund  clients  remain 
defensive,  with increased hedging of broad based ETFs. The 
defensive-cyclical ratio remains close to a 52-week high.  
 
Securities Lending 
The  U.S.  Prime  Brokerage  short  book  experienced  moderate 
covering for a second consecutive month as shorting in single 
name  equities  was  offset  by  reductions  in  ETF  and  fixed 
income exposures. In Europe, directional short interest in UK 
supermarkets stabilized in March and hedge funds continue to 
trade the spread in Spirit Pub Co. PLC  / Greene King PLC. 
 
Institutional Investor Sentiment 
During March, the Capital Introduction Group (CIG) met with 
several of the most active institutional investors in the Chicago 
region.  Demand  for  Asia-focused  strategies  is  particularly 
acute.  Investors  remain  interested  in  discretionary  global 
macro  but  have  been  frustrated  by  their  inability  to  identify 
managers  with  consistent  performance.  In  Europe,  the  CIG 
met with investors in Zurich, where activity appears to be on 
the  increase,  especially  among  family  offices  and  banks. 
Equity  long  short  remains  popular  among  investors  in  Asia, 
particularly  with  respect  to  less  directional  managers  and 
sector specialists. 
 
Market Perspectives 
Recent  signs  indicate  that  Europe’s  economic  trajectory  may 
be at an inflection point and finally on the cusp of a nascent 
recovery.  While  Europe’s  economic  affairs  are  trending 
positively,  its  political  affairs  are  not.  Across  the  continent, 
parties of the far left and right are gaining at the poles. Just as 
a recovery seems to be taking hold in Europe, the continent’s 
politics  are  moving  in  a  direction  that  will  render  growth 
increasingly difficult. 
                                                 
1 Gross leverage is the total market value of long and short positions divided by clients' 
equity in J.P. Morgan’s Prime Brokerage portfolio. 
2 Calculated for Equity Long Short and Market Neutral funds on J.P. Morgan’s Prime 
Brokerage platform only. Net exposure is defined as the market value of long positions 
(LMV) minus the market value of short positions (SMV), divided by clients’ equity (Eq).

Prime Brokerage Global Hedge Fund Trends – Performance, Leverage, and Risk Exposures 

 

 
 
institutional investor interest in greater European exposure is 
on the rise.  
 
The  rapid  year-to-date  ascent  of  the  U.S.  Dollar  (+8.96%) 
continued  in  March.  Even  after  the  Dollar  retreated  in  the 
wake  of  the  FOMC  meeting,  it  was  still  up  +3.22%  on  the 
month. For the quarter, the Dollar has gained against all but 
five currencies (see Figure 3), which highlights the strength 
of  the  U.S.  economy  relative  to  other  regions.  The  recent 
pickup in Europe  may slow  the Dollar’s rise,  which in turn 
could  create  tailwinds  for  U.S.  firms  that  are  reliant  on 
exports.  A  number  of  global  macro  funds  with  long  USD 
exposure have outperformed on this trade.

 This section presents a summary of the changes that we have observed in leverage and sector exposures across the range of hedge funds that we 
work with. The confidentiality of our clients’ positions is important to us and as such this information has been aggregated and displayed in an 
anonymous manner in an effort to mitigate the risk of revealing or alluding to any one fund’s exposures. Information may be excluded due to the 
perceived risk of revealing sensitive information. The information discussed is specific to activities on J.P. Morgan’s books, and may not represent 
total client activity. These numbers should only be viewed as representative observations. 
 
Market Overview 
The combination in March of a strengthening U.S. Dollar and 
weak  economic  data  –  namely,  shortfalls  in  consumer 
spending and durable goods orders – culminated in a Federal 
Open  Markets  Committee  (FOMC)  meeting 
that  was 
surprisingly  dovish.  Not  only  did  the  Fed  remove  the 
“patient”  language  from  its  guidance  –  a  development  that 
had  been  widely  expected  –  but  it  revised  downward  its 
interest  rate  projections  to  a  greater  extent  than  the  market 
had  anticipated.  The  recent  weakness  in  economic  data  and 
the consequent variability now surrounding the timing of the 
Fed’s  prospective  increase  in  forward  rates  has  created  an 
element of uncertainty for investors. 
 
March  was  therefore  a  challenging  month  for  most  risk 
assets, with declining bond yields, a fall in commodities and 
lackluster  equity  markets.  Falling  bond  yields  were  partly  a 
function of Fed dovishness and the European Central Bank’s 
(ECB)  quantitative  easing  program,  which  commenced  on 
March 9. Partly as a result of declining fixed income yields, 
credit spreads widened. Although spreads for U.S. high grade 
bonds increased only 8 basis points, U.S. and European high 
yields spreads widened 29 and 39 basis points, respectively. 
U.S. high yield securities fell -0.58% on the month while the 
10-Year Treasury and high grade bonds gained +0.77% and 
+0.33%,  respectively.  At  the  same  time,  the  yield  for  U.S. 
high yield bonds rose +0.25% month-over-month. 
 
Equities  suffered  a  pullback  in  March.  The  S&P  500  Index 
fell  -1.58%  on  the  month  and  the  MSCI  AC  World  Index 
declined nearly -2%. Emerging markets also were weak, with 
the MSCI EM Index off -1.59%. The retreat for the S&P 500 
was a function largely of soft data, starting with a decrease in 
personal spending and weak auto sales at the outset of March 
and culminating with the downside surprise in durable goods. 
Equity markets were therefore choppy throughout the month. 
Yet,  despite  headwinds  from  the  rising  U.S.  Dollar  and  the 
collapse  in  oil  prices,  equity  markets  fared  reasonably  well 
over  the  first  quarter.  The  S&P  500  rose  +0.95%,  EM 
returned  +1.91%  and  Europe  demonstrated  particular 
strength, with the MSCI EAFE up +4.88% for Q1 as a result 
of 
the  Eurozone. 
Consequently,  many  equity  hedge  funds  are  bullish  on  the 
region and are increasing their exposure to Europe. Similarly,

Volatility rose in March, as the VIX Index increased +14.6% 
to  close  the  month  at  15.29,  above  the  52-week  average  of 
14.59. As shown in Figure 4,  with the exception of copper, 
implied volatilities increased month-over-month, particularly 
with respect to investment  grade credit. A  number of credit 
funds  added  hedges  against  cash  bonds  but  reduced  such 
positions heading into month-end.

Composite Hedge Fund Performance 
All  of  the  major  hedge  fund  strategy  segments  generated 
positive 
in  March,  with  aggregate  average 
performance  of  +0.53%.  Year-to-date,  hedge  funds  have 
returned  +2.42%  in  aggregate,  well  in  excess  of  broader 
market indices.  
 
Global Macro 
Global  macro  strategies  posted  gains  of  +0.70%  in  March 
and  +3.39%  on  the  quarter.  As  has  predominantly  been  the 
case in  most  months preceding March, systematic strategies 
fueled  gains,  with  an  aggregate  return  of  +1.06%.  Over  the 
first  quarter,  such  strategies  generated  aggregate  returns  of 
+5.14%,  largely  as  a  result  of  short  energy  and  long  U.S. 
Dollar (especially versus the Euro) trades. Several managers 
also  profited  from  long  U.S.  rates  positions,  particularly  in 
response to the FOMC meeting. Global macro strategies have 
now  posted  five  months  of  positive  returns  and  have 
generated gains in ten of the preceding twelve months.  
 
Event Driven 
Event driven strategies posted aggregate gains of +0.58% in 
March  and  +2.01%  for  the  first  quarter.  Special  situations 
managers  were  chiefly  responsible  for  those  returns,  rising 
+1.35%  on  the  month.  In  contrast  to  February,  activist 
managers had lackluster returns in March amidst soft equity 
markets. Robust deal activity again resulted in an auspicious 
landscape for merger arbitrage funds, which returned +0.52% 
for  March  and  +2.36%  for  the  first  quarter.  In  particular, 
merger  arbitrage  clients  benefitted  from  positioning  around 
the OptumRX/Catamaran, Omega Healthcare/Aviv REIT and 
Renasant/Heritage Financial transactions. 

Equity Hedge 
Equity  long  short  strategies  returned  +0.51%  in  March  and 
+2.34%  for  the  quarter.  A  number  of  managers  benefitted 
from  stabilizing  oil  prices.  Consequently,  funds  with 
exposure  to  energy  and  basic  materials  posted  aggregate 
returns  of  +2.54%  on  the  month,  and  +3.50% over  the  first 
quarter. Multi-strategy equity platforms posted an aggregate 
+1.84%  in  March  and  had  the  strongest  returns  over  the 
quarter  (+5.70%)  among  any  of  the  equity  sub-strategies. 
Market  neutral  strategies  also  helped  drive  gains  in  March, 
rising +0.70%.  
 
Moreover, as seen in Figure 2 (hedge fund beta to equities), 
hedge  fund  beta  increased  during  March.  That  increase 
partially  reflects  changes  in  portfolio  composition  and 
sensitivity to high beta sectors.

Relative Value 
Fixed  income  relative  value  strategies  returned  +0.25% 
month-over-month,  aided  by  falling  fixed  income  yields. 
However,  high  yield  markets  posed  a  challenge  for  relative 
value managers as spreads widened 29 basis points but while 
generating  a  -0.58%  return  month-over-month.  Portfolio 
hedges,  particularly  with  respect  to  U.S.  rates,  were  a  net 
drag during March.

Gross Leverage 
Across the Prime Brokerage portfolio, gross leverage was flat 
in March at 1.82 (+0.05%) (See Figure 6). Clients remained 
defensive  amidst  an  uptick  in  volatility  (+14.62%).  Hedge 
fund clients remain overweight Consumer, Non-cyclicals and 
have added broad based ETF hedges, which are near 52-week 
highs. Defensive versus cyclical exposures within the Prime 
Brokerage  portfolio  also  remain  at  a  52-week  high.  Gross 
leverage of levered accounts  also  was flat at 2.36 (+0.04%) 
(See Figure 7).

Sector Exposures 
The  largest  month-over-month  increases  in  the  long  Prime 
Brokerage  portfolio  were  Energy  (+0.6%)  and  Consumer, 
Non-Cyclical 
largest  month-over-month 
decline occurred in the Industrial sector (-0.3%).  
 
The largest increase in short exposure in March occurred in 
the  Financial  sector  (+0.9%).  The  largest  decline  in  month-

Materials (-0.4%). 
 
On a month-over-month basis, the Prime Brokerage portfolio 
increased  exposure  to  Energy  and  Basic  Materials,  both  of 
which  saw  an  increase  in  longs  and  a  decline  in  shorts.

over  25  million  shares  in  lending  programs  with 
overnight rates unchanged at GC. 

Fixed Income 
For the first time in 2015, the Prime Brokerage fixed income 
book  experienced  a  net  decrease  in  the  market  value  of 
corporate  bonds. 
Investment  grade,  high  yield  and 
convertible  bonds  all  experienced  net  covering,  while  there 
was  a  slight  increase  in  market  value  of  shorts  in  U.S. 
treasuries.  Within  corporate  credit,  significant  covering  was 
driven  by  large  net  covers  Basic  Materials,  Energy,  and 
Financials.  Throughout  the  month,  the  following  capital 
structures  experienced  a  high  volume  of  inquiries  and/or 
short  volumes:  Peabody  Energy  Corp.  (BTU),  Fortescue  – 
FMG Resources Pt. Ltd. (FMGAU), Transocean Ltd. (RIG), 
and Vale Overseas Ltd. (VALE). 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

 

North America  
Equities 
The U.S. Prime Brokerage short book experienced moderate 
covering for a second consecutive month as shorting in single 
name  equities  was  offset  by  reductions  in  ETF  and  fixed 
income  exposures. Gross  volume  increased  +12%  versus 
February and intra-month volatility was high.  From a sector 
perspective,  the  largest  reductions  occurred  in  Consumer, 
Non-cyclicals  and  Communications  while  Financials  and 
Energy led short increases.   
 
ETFs  
The  U.S.  Prime  Brokerage  ETF  book  was  moderately  net 
covered  in  March. Broad  based  ETFs  such  as SPY  (SPDR 
S&P 500 ETF), IWM (iShares Russell 200 ETF) and MDY 
(SPDR  S&P  MidCap  400  ETF  Trust)  drove  cover  activity. 
Internationally-focused  ETFs  bucked  the  trend,  with  short 
increases in EFA (iShares MSCI EAFE ETF), EWZ iShares 
MSCI  Brazil  Capped  ETF)  and  EEM  (iShares  MSCI 
Emerging  Markets  ETF).  The  largest  inflows  (increase  in 
shares outstanding) occurred in HEDJ (WisdomTree Europe 
Hedged Equity ETF), EFA and IWM.

Prime Brokerage Global Hedge Fund Trends – Securities Lending 

For example, activity was heavy with respect to HSBC (0005 
HK).     
 
Korea 
There  was  heavy  activity  around  banking  names  in  March 
with  considerable  two-way  flow.  Chemicals  and  refiner 
names also saw  significant activity as a result of stabilizing 
oil  price,  which  gave  rise  to  heavy  covering.  Clients 
generally  shied  away  from  industrials  such  as  ship  builders 
and auto names. 
 

Japan 
Prime  Brokerage  short  balances  rose  in  March  while  swap 
balances  also  increased.  There  was  movement  in  client 
balances  during  the  month  as  funds  sought  counter-parties 
offering the best dividend yields. March witnessed continued 
locate  interest  and  borrow  activity  in  names  such  as  Mixi, 
Inc.  (2121  JP),  Cookpad  Inc.  (2193  JP),  Cyberdyne,  Inc. 
(7779 JP), Sharp Corporation (6753 JP), Yamada Denki Co. 
Ltd.  (9831  JP)  and  Emori  Group  Holdings  Co.  Ltd.  (9963 
JP).  
 

Australia 
Activity  picked  up  in  March  with  several  funds  shorting 
Telecom  providers  TPG  Telecom  Limited  (TPM.AX)  and 
iiNet  Limited  (IIN.AX)  based  on  possible  risks  to  the 
proposed  merger.  Iron  ore  shorts  persisted  on  the  back  of 
weakening iron ore spot prices and falling demand in China. 
Funds continued to target large cap  miner Fortescue Metals 
Group  Limited  (FMG.AX)  after  the  company  cancelled  a 
bond issue at the final hour. However, borrow supply is tight 
and funds were therefore capped in the volume of shorts they 
could add.  
 
 

Europe 
Directional  short  interest  in  UK  supermarkets  stabilized  in 
March. There was covering in Tesco PLC (TSCO LN) and J. 
Sainsbury  PLC  (SBRY  LN),  with  Morrison  Supermarkets 
PLC (MRW LN) fairly flat on the month. Only Ocado Group 
PLC  (OCDO  LN)  saw  continued  shorting.  In  mainland 
Europe, Sapiem SpA’s (SPM IM) short base increased by a 
third  last  month  and  is  now  ranked  as  the  top  short  in  the 
STOXX 600 Index as a percent of float. TalkTalk Telecom 
Group  PLC  (TALK  LN)  has  remained  the  most  crowded 
short in the Stoxx600 as  measured by average daily trading 
volume to cover throughout March. TalkTalk has consistently 
ranked  as  the  first  or  second  most  crowded  short  alongside 
Zoopla Property Group PLC in the FTSE 350.  
 
In  the  capital  raising  space,  borrow  in  Banca  Monte  Dei 
Paschi di Siena S.p.A (BMPS IM) was in high demand and 
became even less liquid in March. 
 
In M&A, hedge funds continue to trade the spread in Spirit 
Pub  Co.  PLC  (SPRT  LN)  /  Greene  King  PLC  (GNK  LN), 
with  the borrow cost in Greene King doubling and lending 
pools nearing 90% utilization.  
 
In  convertible  bond  arbitrage,  key  launches  in  March 
included  Telecom  Italia’s  (TIT  IM)  new  €2  billion 
convertible,  Market  Tech’s  (MKT  LN)  new £112.5  million 
issue,  Heidelberger Druckmaschinen’s  (HDD GR) new €56 
million  issue,  and  Aabar  Investment’s  exchangeable  into 
UniCredit  (UCG  IM).  Away  from  the  primary  issues,  there 
has  been  renewed  stock  borrow  demand  Grand  City 
Properties  (GYC  GR),  with  shares  on  loan  hitting  annual 
highs. 
 
Asia Ex-Japan 
Taiwan 
March saw considerable bias to new shorts in names such as 
Taiwan  Semiconductor  Manufacturing  Company  Limited  
(2330 TW) and Largan Precision  Co Ltd (3008 TW). Short 
activity  also  was  driven  by  a  worsening  outlook  for  AU 
Optronics (2409 TW) and MediaTek (2454 TW).   
 
Hong Kong 
The trend in Hong Kong in March was towards covering as 
Chinese  banks  and  insurance  companies  began  reporting. 
While there was limited opportunistic shorting, the majority 
of  activity  was  in  covers  for  China  trackers  and  financials.

Institutional Investor Sentiment 
 
North America 
During March, the CIG met with several of the most active 
institutional  investors  in  the  Chicago  region  to  gauge 
allocation  trends  and  strategy  appetite  for  2015.  Most 
allocators with which the CIG met expressed interest in non-
U.S. focused  managers. Demand for Asia-focused strategies 
is  particularly  acute  and  was  a  common  theme  in  these 
meetings. Other strategies of interest among investors in the 
Chicago  area  are  emerging  markets  and  reinsurance. Such 
demand  seems  to  be  a  function  of  investors’  desire  to 
diversify 
uncorrelated 
opportunities.  Energy  was  another  frequently-mentioned 
strategy of interest. In addition to the distressed energy trade, 
a number of investors are seeking exposure to the sector via 
different  strategies,  including  equity  long  short.  Finally, 
investors remain interested in discretionary global macro but 
have  been  frustrated  by  their  inability  to  identify  managers 
with  consistent  performance.  Demand  for  co-investment 
opportunities remains a persistent theme. 
 
EMEA  
The CIG met with investors in Zurich, where activity appears 
to  be  on  the  increase,  especially  among  family  offices  and 
banks, many of which are adjusting their asset allocations in 
favor of hedge funds. The overall trend among family offices 
is an increase in exposure to less correlated strategies such as 
discretionary  global  macro  and  equity  managers  with  tight 
net  exposures.  Banks  and  asset  managers  are  developing 
UCITS  offerings  in  response  to  client  demand,  and  family 
offices  are  increasingly  looking  at  UCITS  as  an  alternative 
cash  management  tool. Another  trend  among  family  offices 
includes growing interest in Asia-focused strategies. 
 
Asia Pacific 
Equity long short remains popular among investors in Asia, 
particularly  with  respect  to  less  directional  managers  and 
sector specialists.  Other strategies that have captured pockets 
of  interest  include  multi-strategy,  CTAs  and  fixed  income 
relative value. Among investors in Japan, European strategies 
have  started  to  garner  attention,  particularly  in  light  of  the 
ECB’s easing program.

Prime Brokerage Global Hedge Fund Trends – Market Perspectives 

March Commentary  
Recent signs indicate that Europe’s economic trajectory may 
be at an inflection point and finally on the cusp of a nascent 
recovery. Although growth in the Euro zone during the first 
quarter  of  2015  came  in  below  expectations  (0.2  versus 
projections  of  0.4),  March  saw  added  momentum.  Both  the 
Euro  zone’s  composite  PMI  and  economic  sentiment 
indicator were robust in March and private sector activity in 
Germany increased at the briskest pace since May 2011. The 
ECB is now projecting growth of +1.5% for 2015, aided by 
the tailwinds of falling energy prices, a weakening Euro and 
higher  confidence  induced  partly  as  a  result  of  the  ECB’s 
easing  program,  pursuant  to  which  the  central  bank  will 
purchase in excess of €1 trillion in covered and government 
bonds by September 2016. The ECB projects that, although 
inflation  will  remain  in  neutral  during  2015,  it  will  achieve 
the 2% target rate by 2017.  
 
While Europe’s economic affairs are trending positively, its 
political  affairs  are  not.  Across  the  continent,  parties  of  the 
far left and right are gaining at the poles – see, e.g., Syriza in 
Greece, UK’s Independence Party and the National Front in 
France  –  as  a  result  of  increasing  hostility  to  the  European 
project at local levels. Such sentiment poses a threat to many 
of  the  structural  reforms  that  were  implemented  across  the 
continent  in  recent  years.  Just  as  a  recovery  seems  to  be 
taking hold in Europe, the continent’s politics are moving in 
a direction that will render growth increasingly difficult. 
 
The  following  sections  are  excerpts  from  J.P.  Morgan 
Research  publications.  The  full  publications  can  be

US: is the dollar starting to drag? 5
 
 
Although  some  market  commentators  have  argued  that  the 
dollar’s recent move  was driven by positive news about the 
US  outlook  and  thus  that  its  potential  negative  implications 
for US GDP have been overstated,  we disagree. Since June 
2014,  the  FOMC  has  downgraded  its  outlook  for  GDP 
growth  over  2014-2015,  and  derivatives  markets  have 
lowered their forecasts  for the pace of Fed  hiking. We thus 
see little reason to believe that the dollar’s move since then 
can  be  explained  by  improvements  in  the  US  outlook. 
Further, we do not view the distinction between dollar moves 
driven by the US growth outlook and moves driven by other 
factors  as  crucial  for  predicting  implications  for  the  net 
                                                 
5 J.P. Morgan Economic Research, Economic Research Note, March 26, 2015:

export  contribution  to  GDP.  In  both  cases,  we  expect  the 
partial  equilibrium  effect  of  dollar  strength  to  be  a  drag  on 
net exports that should be reflected in our forecasts . . . .  
 
We do note, as some market commentators have pointed out, 
that the level of foreign GDP itself can play an independent 
role  in  determining  export  growth,  as  it  does  in  these 
regression  models.  The  J.P.  Morgan  Forecast  Revision 
Indexes  show  that  we  have  downgraded  near-term  GDP 
growth forecasts outside the United States by 1.2%-pts on net 
since the middle of last year. If this downgrade represented a 
permanent shock to the level of foreign GDP, our estimates 
suggest an additional drag of about 2.2%-pts on real exports, 
or 0.3%-pt on US GDP. This direct effect is modest relative 
to the dollar’s, and if the downgrade is eventually paid back 
in the form of higher future foreign growth, the net long-run 
effect should revert to zero. 
 
 
Oil Market Monthly6
 
We revise  up our 2015 and  2016 Brent forecasts by$10/bbl 
and  $5/bbl  to  $59/bbl  and  $62/bbl,  respectively,  as  market 
rebalancing  has  outpaced  our  expectations.  Cuts  to  capex 
plans  by  E&P  companies,  most  notably  in  the  US,  but  also 
elsewhere,  have  been  more  aggressive  year-to-date  than 
assumed in our previous balance. Separately, we see initials 
signs  of  demand  improvement  in  some  EM  economies, 
although  it  is  still  premature  to  extrapolate  the  nascent 
recovery  into  full-blown  upgrades  to  demand  estimates, 
particularly  against  the  backdrop  of  deteriorating  GDP 
growth expectations. Excluding the US we find little data to 
substantiate our expectation of rapid 1Q2015 crude builds, in 
part explaining the underperformance of WTI so far this year. 
 
Our  revised  view  regarding  US  production  growth  and 
potential  declines  elsewhere  may  seem  relatively  innocuous 
in near-term barrels per day terms, but it is the chipping away 
at  the  volumetric  Atlantic  Basin  oversupply  that  has  most 
impacted  price  formation  at  the  margin.  The  quicker-than-
expected  pace  of  signs  of  demand-side  green  shoots  and 
upstream  adjustments  prevented  the  expected  depth  of  the 
price  collapse  from  being  achieved,  and  our  bottom-up 
assessment  of  US  supply  developments  underpins 
the 
magnitude of our upward forecasted price revisions.

all or a substantial amount of its investment. While hedge funds are subject 
to  market  risks  common  to  other  types  of  investments,  including  market
